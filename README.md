# TicTacToe.NET

TicTacToe.NET is a game of tic tac toe written entirely in C# utilizing WPF for its front-end needs and setup to be extensible if needed. It has also been entirely documented in a form of a tutorial for others to learn from.

This is a repository for one of my ongoing tutorials called "C# Programming For Beginners". Please checkout the link for the playlist below.
